- is remapping nodes a cost that's too high to afford?


- add optional node id provided by the user
- add label id key to regionprops operator
- add somekind of type checking or recording when adding attributes on database
- add attribute class for nodes:
    - this class would have default attributes
    - and support arbitrary attributes

    class NodeAttr:
        t = "t"
        segm_id: int = 0
        spatial_columns = ["x", "y", "z"]

    class RegionPropsOperator(BaseNodesOperator):

        node_attr = NodeAttr()
